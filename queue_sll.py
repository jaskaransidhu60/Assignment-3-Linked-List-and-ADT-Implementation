# Description: Implements a Queue ADT using a Singly Linked List with support for efficient enqueue, dequeue, and front-peek operations.
# This queue structure facilitates O(1) time complexity for each primary operation by maintaining both head and tail pointers.

class Queue:
    def __init__(self):
        pass  # initialize linked list-based queue
    
    def enqueue(self, value: object) -> None:
        pass  # implement enqueue
    
    def dequeue(self) -> object:
        pass  # implement dequeue
    
    def front(self) -> object:
        pass  # implement front peek
